# Constantino (apologeticaly)
I'm Muhammed Constantino, a Senior at [Make School](https://github.com/MakeSchool) pursuing a B.S. in Applied Computer Science. Since there are usualy 50 Muhammed's in the room, I go by my last name. On track for graduation in Summer 2021, I am currently looking for fulltime positions as either a PM or FEW Engineer in San Francisco. In Summer 2020 I interned at [Western Digital](https://www.wdc.com) as a Product Line Management Intern, and in high school I interned at a startup call [Courtbuddy](https://www.courtbuddy.com). I've lived in the Bay Area since I was 9, before that I hail from Toronto 🇨🇦️. Thanks for visiting my repo!

⚽️ Football! Being Brazilian, I'm obliged to love and scream the sport :D<br>

## What I'm Looking For
As I mentioned above, currently I am looking for a fulltime position as a Product Manager or Front End Web Engineer. As I will be moving there in the coming months, the position would have to be located in San Francisco. I value a fast-paced work environment, with oppurtunities to interact with many different teams while brainstorming creative solutions to shared problems. I've worked in environments with isolated teams and it ain't fun :/. Besides that, a resemblence of work-life balance is very important to me, as we work to live and not vice versa.

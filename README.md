# Constantino
I'm Muhammed Constantino, a Senior at [Make School](https://github.com/MakeSchool) pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. Since there are usually 50 Muhammed's in any given room, I go by my last name! On track for graduation in Summer 2021, I am currently looking for full time positions as either a PM or Software Engineer in San Francisco. During the Summer of 2020 I interned at [Western Digital](https://www.wdc.com) as a Product Line Management Intern, and in high school I interned at a startup call [Courtbuddy](https://www.courtbuddy.com). I've lived in the Bay Area since I was 9, originally I’m from Toronto 🇨🇦️. Thanks for visiting my GitHub!

## My Skills
🗣️ Fluency in VanillaJS, ReactJS, DJango and Flask<br>
🐍️ Mathematical modeling in Python such as the one used for [Lichtman2020](https://lichtman2020.com) election model<br>
📦️ PM experience from mockup to shipped (both software and physical products)<br>
🎨️ Mastery in the full AdobeCC Suite<br>
📱️ Social media management / content creation<br>
🚀 I constantly look at the bigger picture, and how my team as a whole can reach our goals.

## My Passions
🏞️ Nature<br>
🎞️ Film photography, from shot to scan<br>
📖️ Reading about history (see The Story of Civilization)<br>
⚽️ Football! Being Brazilian, I'm obliged to love and scream the sport :D<br>
💪️ Fitness. A healthy body is a healthy mind

## What I'm Looking For
As I mentioned above, currently I am looking for a full time position as a Product Manager or Front End Web Engineer. As I will be moving there in the coming months, the position would have to be located in San Francisco. I value a fast-paced work environment, with opportunities to interact with many different teams while brainstorming creative solutions to shared problems. I've worked in environments with isolated teams and it ain't fun :/. Besides that, a resemblance of work-life balance is very important to me, as we work to live and not vice versa.
